Introduction: Marketing & Business Services for Small Businesses
Dear Business Owner,

Who I Am
My name is Jurie Smit, and I have over 20 years of experience in software development and business technology solutions. After a successful career as a system architect and technical leader (which you can verify on LinkedIn at linkedin.com/in/juriesmit), I'm now offering specialized marketing and business enhancement services to small business owners like yourself.

I previously owned and operated my own small business, which gave me firsthand experience with the challenges and opportunities that entrepreneurs face daily. While I had to step back from that venture due to medical reasons, I'm now ready to leverage my technical expertise and business experience to help other small business owners thrive in today's digital marketplace.

My Unique Position in the Market
Unlike typical options available to small business owners, I offer a distinct middle-ground approach:

More Professional Than DIY Solutions: I provide significantly higher quality than template-based website builders, without requiring you to become a technical expert

More Affordable Than Large Agencies: I deliver professional results without the overhead costs and unnecessary complexity of large marketing firms

More Personal Than Freelance Marketplaces: You work directly with me—an experienced professional—not with junior staff or through account managers

More Practical Than One-Size-Fits-All Solutions: I create systems tailored to your specific business needs, not generic templates or overly complex platforms

Why I Can Help Your Refrigeration & Air Conditioning Business
As a one-person operated refrigeration and air conditioning business, you excel at providing technical expertise and quality service to your customers. However, I understand that marketing, online presence, and business systems often take a back seat when you're focused on delivering your core services.

This is where I can add significant value:

Digital Presence Development: Creating a professional website that emphasizes emergency services and your local service area

Local Business Visibility: Implementing targeted strategies to ensure people searching for refrigeration and air conditioning services in your specific neighborhoods find you first

Business Systems Optimization: Streamlining your appointment scheduling, customer management, and follow-up processes to save you time between service calls

Technical Documentation: Developing professional service reports, maintenance checklists, and customer education materials

Seasonal Marketing: Creating strategies to balance workload between peak cooling seasons and slower periods

My Approach for Refrigeration & Air Conditioning Businesses
My approach is specifically tailored for skilled trades professionals like yourself:

1. Understanding Your Business
We start by thoroughly understanding your services, customer base, service area, and what makes your refrigeration and air conditioning business unique.

2. Digital Foundation
I'll establish a professional online presence with a website designed to generate leads and showcase your expertise. This includes emergency service callouts, service area maps, and easy contact options.

3. Local Visibility
I'll implement local SEO strategies to ensure your business appears prominently when potential customers search for refrigeration and air conditioning services in your specific service neighborhoods.

4. Practical Business Systems
I'll set up simple but effective systems for appointment scheduling, customer follow-up, maintenance reminders, and other operational processes that save you time between service calls.

5. Affordable Ongoing Support
I provide flexible support options at a fraction of what agencies charge, allowing you to focus on what you do best—providing excellent refrigeration and air conditioning services.

Why This Matters to Your Business
In the refrigeration and air conditioning industry, customers are looking for reliability, expertise, and professionalism. A strong online presence communicates these qualities before you even meet a potential customer. Additionally:

Emergency Services: When customers have urgent cooling or refrigeration issues, they immediately search online for available services
Seasonal Demand: Effective marketing helps smooth out seasonal fluctuations by highlighting different services throughout the year
Maintenance Contracts: Professional online presence helps convert one-time repairs into ongoing maintenance relationships
Differentiation: Standing out from competitors who may not have invested in their online presence
The Value Proposition
Working with me offers several key advantages:

Cost-Effective: Professional results at 30-50% less than marketing agencies
Time-Saving: Systems that reduce your administrative workload
Expertise-Focused: Highlighting your technical knowledge and experience
Growth-Oriented: Scalable solutions that grow with your business
Practical Implementation: No unnecessary features or complexity
Next Steps
I've enclosed several documents that outline my services in more detail:

Website Development Proposal: Options for establishing your online presence
Digital Marketing Roadmap: A phased approach to building your visibility
Website Planning Questionnaire: To help us understand your specific needs
Business Systems Proposal: Practical tools to streamline your operations
